Link for the [Planner](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11bKywOwpnw5yYKCn8gzfvOqJyZuN1zEjaDKdR0XZ-Xk/edit?usp=sharing) (Planner may not be accurate as we changed stuff while working on it)

The purpose of this project is for practicing collaboration with another person, creativity, and praticing clickable working links that allow users to go from files to files. Most importantly, the teacher told us to do this so yeah we have to follow.
