Your opponent comes out of the other side. He look small and weak so you underestimate him. In the fight you throw the first hit but he dodges it effortlessly. In the next second you are on the floor close to death. You start to wonder why you got beaten up so easily just to realize you forgot to train in a fighting sytle.
